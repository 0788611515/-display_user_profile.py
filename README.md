### -display_user_profile.py
# coded and run by Alex Sylvainb Luenga 
write a module in C (call it user_profile.c) that call your python script in Question this is anything you can write 
 1. ref: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/call.html It will need 2 functions: void init_user_profile(void) display a “user profile icon” and the necessary javascript to do the right thing when you click it. So this function needs to printf the following HTML code: • an iframe html tag inside a wrapper div block with style “visibility = hidden” • a div tag containing a svg user profile icon add an “onclick” event to the div that will: ◦ change iframe’s src = ‘app.cgi?viewid=1000&amp;mode=0’ ◦ change the wrapper div block’s visibility = visible have this init function print out any javascript functions or styles that you want to do this void display_user_profile(const int userid) this function will get called by the main routine for viewid=1000....assume all of this exists – it  will call your function and pass you the userid of the current users that is logged in. this function must then call your python routine (in question 1) to display the html that will be  included in the iframe. Obviously, there is a lot of stuff missing, so your C code will not compile.  The question is really to see that you have the ability to interface with a python script in C, and  that you have a decent understanding of web front end technologies (ie html, javascript, css  etc..) and most importantly, your style of programming
